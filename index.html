                    <h2>What is IoT?</h2>
                    <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of physical devices—such as appliances, vehicles, sensors, 
                        and other objects—embedded with software, sensors, and connectivity that allow them to collect, exchange, 
                        and act on data over the internet. These devices can operate autonomously or be controlled remotely, 
                        enabling smarter decision-making, automation, and enhanced convenience in areas like healthcare, manufacturing, 
                        transportation, and home living. As IoT continues to grow, it is transforming everyday 
                        objects into intelligent, interconnected systems.</p>
    
                    <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionizing the way we live and work by connecting billions of 
                        devices—from smart thermostats and wearable fitness trackers to industrial sensors and autonomous vehicles. 
                        These devices gather and share data to enable automation, efficiency, and real-time insights. However, 
                        this rapid expansion comes with significant security concerns. Many IoT devices are developed with limited 
                        computing resources and minimal built-in security, often prioritizing functionality and cost-efficiency over 
                        protection. As a result, they become vulnerable points of entry for cybercriminals.</p>

                    <h2>Introduction to IoT Threats</h2>
                    <p>
                        IoT threats refer to the various cybersecurity risks associated with the use and integration of connected 
                        devices in networks. These threats include unauthorized access, data breaches, device hijacking, 
                        denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and the exploitation of software vulnerabilities. The diversity of devices, 
                        lack of standardized security protocols, and often-infrequent firmware updates make it difficult to manage 
                        and secure the growing IoT ecosystem effectively.
