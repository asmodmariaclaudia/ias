                <p><strong>Ring Home – Security Camera Breach</strong><br>
                  The Amazon-owned company Ring has made quite a name for itself in recent years for two separate security incidents. Once for accidentally revealing user data to both Facebook and Google via third party trackers embedded into their android application, and secondly due to an IoT security breach whereby cybercriminals successfully hacked into several families’ connected doorbell and home monitoring systems.

                  How did they do it? By using a variety of weak, recycled and default credentials, hackers were able to access live feeds from the cameras around customers’ homes and were even able to communicate remotely using the devices integrated microphones and speakers. In fact, more than 30 people in 15 families reported that hackers were verbally harassing them.

                <p><strong>Nortek Security & Control – Access Control System Breach</strong><br>
                  Now if securing your home with smart devices isn’t your cup of tea, how about the office? Many businesses have recently transitioned from the traditional lock and key to digital building access systems, reliant on physical key cards, access codes and even biometric technologies to allow employees access to building complexes without the need for a keychain the size of a small dog.

                  However, these systems are not exempt from IoT security breaches. In May 2019 research by Applied Risk (a cyber security firm) identified 10 vulnerabilities in the Nortek Linear eMerge E3 devices that would allow hackers to hijack credentials, take control of devices (opening/locking doors), install malware, and launch DoS (Denial of Service) attacks all whilst circumventing the security measures in place.

                  Despite being made aware of these vulnerabilities, six of which had a severity score of 9.8 or 10 out of 10, NSC failed to provide patches for quite some time, during which ten’s of thousands of hits were being identified daily across 100 countries.

                <p><strong>Household Appliances – Botnet Attacks</strong><br>
                  Something a little less scary, but just as concerning is the risk of attacks on seemingly innocuous devices, such as smart fridges and washing machines. Household appliances such as these don’t usually hold particularly sensitive data, or have potential privacy breaching attachments like cameras and microphones. So why would hackers want to target them?

                  As we begin to connect an increasing number of household appliances via IoT we present a new attack surface. Hackers that once had to penetrate the advanced cyber defences of a business, can now leverage gaps in the security of the products and appliances not previously considered by manufacturers. Investigations by various cyber security researchers globally have identified a staggering number of these devices connected to botnets.

                  According to Gartner, currently, 40% of smart home appliances globally are being used for botnet attacks.
                  What is a botnet? For those not familiar with this term, a botnet is a form of malware that can infect appliances and often go unnoticed by the owner, having almost zero impact on the owner’s security. However, botnets can be used by hackers to perform attacks via the web. According to Wired Magazine, if hackers controlled a botnet which had silently hacked thousands of large loT household appliances (such as air conditioners and water heaters), cybercriminals could de-stabilise an entire power grid. Although an attack on this scale has only ever been simulated for research, there have already been many real-world examples of IoT security breaches on fridges and even fish tanks.

                <p><strong>St Jude Medical – IoT Security Breaches in Healthcare</strong><br>
                  The nature of IoT devices means that data is constantly being transmitted, processed and collected in the cloud, often without any encryption. If a hacker was able to access a medical IoT device, they could use it to manipulate information and transmit false signals. If a healthcare practitioner were to act on one of these signals it could have a significant impact on the patient’s treatment.
                  
                  Even more terrifying, what would happen if a hacker could take control of an IoT pacemaker or defibrillator? Research given to the FDA found that St Jude Medical’s implantable cardiac devices have vulnerabilities. If hackers were able to gain access they could deplete the battery or administer incorrect pacing or shocks.

                  Thankfully no patients have been harmed as a result of the vulnerabilities and St Jude has since developed a software patch to fix the problem that occurred in the devices’ transmitter.

          <h4>CONCLUSION<br><br>
            The Internet of Things brings unparalleled convenience and efficiency, but its vulnerabilities expose 
            societies to critical risks—from data breaches to national infrastructure disruption. As the number of 
            connected devices continues to surge, it is essential to adopt a multi-layered, collaborative, and proactive 
            approach to IoT security. By investing in security frameworks, public education, and regulatory compliance, 
            societies can adapt, resist, and recover from these evolving threats and ensure the 
            continued benefits of a connected world.</h4>
