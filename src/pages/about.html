                    Hello! My name is <strong class="content-showcase-text-emphasis">Maria Claudia A. Asmod</strong>, and I'm a 20-year-old BSIT student
                    currently in my third year at Gingoog City Colleges, Inc. While I’m still building my knowledge in cybersecurity, I’m deeply passionate about learning and excited to explore the ever-evolving world of technology.

                <p class="content-showcase-paragraph-details">
                    I created this website as a final output for my subject, Information
                    Assurance and Security 2 (IAS 102). Through this project, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of the threats associated with the Internet of Things (IoT)—a rapidly growing area of concern in today's highly connected digital landscape. As more everyday devices become linked to the internet, the risks to privacy, data security, and system integrity continue to rise. By exploring this topic, I hope to shed light on the vulnerabilities within IoT systems and contribute to the conversation on how we can better protect users and infrastructure from emerging cyber threats.

                <p class="content-showcase-paragraph-ambition">
                    Even as a student, I am motivated to take part in the ongoing conversation about cybersecurity and its far-reaching effects on society. I believe that by sharing knowledge, encouraging awareness, and engaging others in meaningful discussions, I can make a modest yet meaningful contribution to promoting a more informed and resilient digital community.
